Abductive event reasoning requires identifying the most plausible causes for a given event, a task that demands deep causal understanding and precise evidence verification. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often fail in this domain because a single retrieval step may miss granular details—such as specific timestamps or actor sequences—necessary to establish a valid causal link. In this paper, we propose a specialized agentic framework designed for multiple-choice causal inference. Our system employs a dual-agent architecture: a Search Agent that performs iterative gap analysis to gather missing evidence, and a Causal Agent that applies abductive logic based on temporal precedence and counterfactual reasoning. To maximize recall, we implement a hybrid retrieval engine using multi-view semantic search and heuristic keyword boosting. Additionally, we explore an extension using Causal Knowledge Graphs to capture multi-hop relational dependencies. Experimental results on the SemEval 2026 Task 12 dataset show that our agentic approach effectively mitigates information gaps. While graph-based methods offer theoretical advantages, we find that our agentic framework currently provides more robust performance across diverse topics due to lower noise in the retrieved context.
